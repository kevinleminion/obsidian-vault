Recall that calculus exists to answer the simple question of how we describe things that continuously change. Things like growth, flow, and accumulation cannot be easily described through algebra or other methods. *Derivatives* describe the current rate of change, while *integrals* describe how much changes in **total**, or simply the area of a curve. 
## Limits
A limit simply describes the behaviour of a function as it approaches a certain value. It doesn't equal anything.
