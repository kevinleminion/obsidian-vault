>Basic stuff concerning MATH 249 concepts that $\textbf{should}$ be known for MATH 267. While concepts like limits and derivatives will be covered, MATH 267 has a much larger emphasis on integration.

Recall that calculus exists to answer the simple question of how we describe things that continuously change. Things like growth, flow, and accumulation cannot be easily described through algebra or other methods. *Derivatives* describe the current rate of change, while *integrals* describe how much changes in **total**, or simply the area of a curve. 
## Limits
A limit simply describes the behaviour of a function as it approaches a certain value. It doesn't equal anything.

> We search for a *trend* in the function rather than the value itself; this 


## Derivatives
The instantaneous rate of change of any given point on the graph, determined through the slope of a tangent line.

> [!warning]
> You cannot just use the $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ formula for a specific point because both values for change will be equal to 0.

To work around this caveat, we instead use a **non-zero** interval, one that becomes infinitely small. A **derivative** is then the value that the average rate approaches as the interval shrinks to zero.
