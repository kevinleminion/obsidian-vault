# Formatting
Things like how to make headers, sections, and subsections.

**\# Topic** creates a large header that is commonly used at the beginning of sections
**\## Section** creates a smaller header that you can use for sections
**\### Subsection** is the smallest header size you can create

> [!info] 
> You can stack up to 6 # symbols before your header text, which sets the level of the heading.
## Word Modification

\*\*bold text\** to **bold text**.
\*italic* to *italicize text*.
\==highlight\== to ==highlight text.== 
\`inline code\` to write `inline code.` 

*You can still use LaTeX notation such as \textbf{} or \textit{} accordingly, but it will almost always be simpler to use the asterisk method.*

 (-) to create a bullet point
(1.) to create a numerical list

## Callouts
Used to effectively create big noticable blocks of text, quite like the one at the beginning of this document. Click on each one to expand it and figure out how to create it, I'm feeling lazy.

> [!note] Overview
> Big picture / intuition

> [!definition]
> Formal definition

> [!example]
> Worked example

> [!warning]
> Common mistake / exam trap

> [!info] Here's a callout title
> Here's a callout block.
> It supports **Markdown**, [[Internal link|Wikilinks]], and [[Embed files|embeds]]!

> [!faq]- Are callouts foldable?
> Yes! In a foldable callout, the contents are hidden when the callout is collapsed.

> [!question] Can callouts be nested?
> > [!todo] Yes!, they can.
> > > [!example]  You can even use multiple layers of nesting.

As for callout types, you can use the following types, which will change the callout as necessary. $\textbf{note, abstract, info, todo, tip, success, question, warning, failure, danger, bug, example, quote}$
# LaTeX Commands
Obsidian supports MathJax rather than full LaTeX, so this section is from the MathJax documents.

> [!failure]
> Because Obsidian operates on MathJax, you *CANNOT* do anything that requires a package or environments.

Use single dollar signs `$....$` to create inline equations, and use double dollar signs `$$...$$` to create block equations. Latex Suite can be used to shorten the process of typing in LaTeX.

Same as for the Callouts, simply click on the following symbols to determine the format and how to create them.

- $x^2$ 
- $\frac{6}{7}$
- $\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} f(x) = 0$ 
- $\binom{6}{7}$
- $\frac{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}}{y-z}$
- $\int_0^\infty \mathrm{e}^{-x}\,\mathrm{d}x$
